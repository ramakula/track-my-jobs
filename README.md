# Track My Jobs

## A simple job tracker

Track your jobs and show off your statistics!

#### Motivation

I started my job search using a "free" web job tracker, but after about two
weeks, I was capped at the number of jobs I could add to this web job tracker.
So I just started using a spreadsheet editor, which was fine until I wanted
to see statistics about my job progress. I had put red **x**'s in the column
for "rejected" by employers and blacked out the row, but I couldn't count that
number or do any statistics because the column entries were **x**'s instead of
numbers (maybe there is a way in this spreadsheet editor?). So I decided to
create this app.
